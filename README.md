# Impact of MVC and MVVM Architectures on Test Quality: An Analysis of GitHub Open-Source Repositories

## Abstract
This study compared the quality of test code in projects based on the \textit{Model-View-Controller} (MVC) and \textit{Model-View-ViewModel} (MVVM) architectures in GitHub repositories. The effectiveness of test suites was evaluated through mutation testing. The methods included calculating the fault detection rate, exploring the relationship between code coverage and test effectiveness, and analyzing the incidence of mutants that result in compile-time errors. The research employed \textit{Stryker.NET} for the automated execution of mutation tests and subsequently applied statistical analyses to interpret the collected data. The study showed no evidence of impact of architectural choices on test effectiveness. Results also showed mild correlation between code coverage of tests and mutation score. This is an important finding, since previews studies suggested that more modularized frameworks would provide better testability.
